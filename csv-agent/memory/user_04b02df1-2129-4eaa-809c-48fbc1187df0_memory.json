      "assistant_response": "{\n  \"answer\": \"Based on the dataset summary, Product B appears to be the 'worst' performing product when compared to Product A. This assessment is supported by two key metrics: average transaction amount and average number of orders. Product B has a lower average transaction amount (200.0) compared to Product A (250.0), and it also has fewer average orders (9.5 vs. 12.33 for Product A). Additionally, the highest recorded transaction amount (300) was for Product A, indicating stronger peak performance. Given the limited dataset of only 5 rows, these conclusions should be treated as preliminary. However, within the current data scope, Product B consistently underperforms relative to Product A.\",\n  \"followUp\": [\n    \"Would you like to investigate potential reasons for Product B's lower performance, such as pricing, marketing, or customer feedback?\",\n    \"Should we analyze Product B's performance over time to identify any improving or declining trends?\",\n    \"Do you want to explore strategies to improve Product B's sales, such as promotions or product enhancements?\"\n  ]\n}",
