This assessment is supported by two key metrics: average transaction amount and order volume. Product B has a lower average amount of 200.0, compared to Product A's 250.0. Additionally, the average number of orders for Product B is 9.5, which is significantly lower than Product A's 12.33. There are no recorded anomalies or outliers suggesting unusual underperformance beyond this consistent gap in performance metrics. Therefore, Product B is performing worse in terms of both revenue and demand.\",\n  \"followUp\": [\n    \"Should we analyze the profit margin of Product B to determine if it's still profitable despite lower sales?\",\n    \"Would you like to see a time-series breakdown of when Product B underperforms the most?\",\n    \"Do you want recommendations on how to improve Product B's performance or consider discontinuing it?\"\n  ]\n}",
