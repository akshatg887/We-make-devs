      "business_overview": "Pune\u2019s bakery market is moderately saturated with 22 active bakeries, averaging a strong 4.13-star rating. The top five competitors\u2014Oven Fresh, Fresh Bread, Daily Bread, Sweet Delights, and Morning Fresh\u2014command solid customer bases and operate primarily in the medium\u2011to\u2011premium price segment. While overall search interest for bakeries is currently on a declining trend, the city\u2019s growing middle\u2011class population, rising disposable incomes, and increasing demand for convenient, ready\u2011to\u2011eat products still present a viable opportunity for a differentiated bakery that emphasizes health\u2011focused and digitally enabled offerings.
